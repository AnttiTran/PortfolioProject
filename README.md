My name is Antti Tran. This is my Github, where I post projects that I have been working on:
- Data exploration on SQL: This project involves analyzing COVID-19 data using SQL to gain insights into the pandemic's impact on different regions. The primary focus is on calculating vaccination rates and understanding the relationship between vaccination efforts and COVID-19 case and death rates.
- Data cleaning on SQL: This project focuses on cleaning and preparing the Nashville Housing dataset for better analysis and visualization. Data cleaning is a critical step to ensure the accuracy and reliability of insights drawn from the data.
- Web scrapping data on Python: This Python project is to scrape data from Tokmani using BeautifulSoup and Requests.
