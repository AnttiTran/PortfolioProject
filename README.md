# PortfolioProject COVID-19 Data Analysis Project
This project involves analyzing COVID-19 data using SQL to gain insights into the pandemic's impact on different regions. The primary focus is on calculating vaccination rates and understanding the relationship between vaccination efforts and COVID-19 case and death rates.

Key Components:

Data Sources: Two datasets are used, one for COVID-19 case and death statistics (CovidDeaths table) and another for vaccination records (CovidVaccination table).

SQL Operations:
- Data Cleaning and Integration: Combining datasets using SQL JOIN operations to integrate COVID-19 case data with vaccination data.
- Aggregations and Calculations: Using SQL window functions and aggregate functions to calculate total vaccinations over time, death percentages, and vaccination rates.
- Temporary Table Usage: Storing intermediate results in temporary tables for further analysis.
  
Main Objective:

To calculate the percentage of the population vaccinated across various locations and analyze how vaccination rates correlate with the spread and severity of COVID-19.
